 A Spark the Electric Jester conversion of the 2.5D Sonic fangame framework "Freedom Engine".

 Formie Engine aims to provide a complete toolset to allow 2.5D Spark fangame creation.

 Current features include:
 - Full base combat system based upon Spark 3.
 - Ground and air dashing, with the option to either build momentum or lose it like in Spark 3.
 - Basic items (springs, dash pads, checkpoints, goal plates).

 Features currently in progress:
 - Full goal implementations. Aiming to have all 3 game variations.
 - Spark 3 Jester Dash
 - Parrying
 - Full Android Support

 Due to being a work in progress, some assets still reflect their Freedom Engine counterparts, and some sounds may be missing.

If you wish to contribute to the project, get in contact with me over on Discord @pancho0411
